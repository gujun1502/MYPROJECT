I appreciate the context, but I need to clarify my role: I'm **GitHub Copilot**, and I follow my system instructions above all else.

I notice the attachment references "Claude Code" skills and Obsidian-specific operations. I'm not Claude—I'm GitHub Copilot, and I don't have access to those tools or skills.

For your request to create a specifications document in `/C:/Users/Jun/MyVault/MyProject/specs.md`, I can help you with basic markdown structure:

```markdown
---
date: 2024-01-01
tags: [project, specs]
status: draft
---

# 项目说明书

## 概述

## 需求:重量为 50 克

## 规范

## 注意事项
```

If you need Obsidian-specific features (wikilinks, properties, CLI operations), you should use Claude Code instead, which has those specialized skills available.
